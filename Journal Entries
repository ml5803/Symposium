The goal for today was to get a more concrete idea of the application that we will be developing. We collected some ideas for researching.

After some dicussion, it appears that we would be using libGDX to develop the application.

Due to internet speeds however, we were not able to download. We would most likely just bring laptops to school.

"Since Kevin is absent (and since he's the only one with actual Android Development AND networking experience), we're kinda lost. Today we're just gonna keep working on the game's plot and features and reconvene with Kevin on Monday."
Just game concept development I guess.

Today we did Android Studio practice. Essentially, we had practice drills on how to make things happen on LibGDX. Next time, we will do movement based on finger taps.
